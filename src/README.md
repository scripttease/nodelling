# Usage

In order to authenticate your requests to the github api you will need to generate a personal authentification token (https://github.blog/2013-05-16-personal-api-tokens/)[https://github.blog/2013-05-16-personal-api-tokens/]

Once you have this - to avoid the token being in version control, create a file called .env and copy the format of .env.example but replace "something" with your token.
